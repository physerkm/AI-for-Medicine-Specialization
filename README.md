## **1.1 Welcome to the AI for Medicine Specialization**

### **Welcome to the Specialization**

Given an image of a chest X-ray, so unstructured image data, can we train a neural network to diagnose whether or not a patient has pneumonia? Or given structure data such as the patient's lab results, can we train a decision tree to estimate the risk of heart attack? By working on these concrete problems, we also see a lot of the practical aspects of machine learning from how they deal with imbalanced data sets, to how to work with missing data, to picking the right evaluation metric. In machine learning, we often default to classification accuracy as the metric. But for many applications, that's not the right metric.

How do we choose a more appropriate one? AI for medicine is taking off all around the world right now. So this is actually a great time for you to jump in and try to have a huge impact. Maybe you can be the one to invent something that saves a lot of patients' lives.

This is a 3-course specialization. In the 1. course, we learned about building machine learning models for diagnosis. Diagnosis is about identifying disease. In the 1. course, we will build an algorithm that will look at a chest X-ray and determine whether it contains disease. We will also build another algorithm that will look at brain MRIs and identify the location of tumors in those brain MRIs. The 2. course will be on predicting the future health of the patients, which is called prognosis. In the 2. course, we will learn how to work with structured data. Let's say, we have a patient's lab values and their demographics, and use those to predict the risk of an event, such as their risk of death or their risk of a heart attack. In the 3. course, we learned about AI for treatment. That is, for the process of medical care and also for information extraction, getting information out of medical texts.

In Course 2, we will learn how to use machine learning models to be able to estimate what the effect of a particular treatment would be on a patient. We will also learn about the application of AI to text for particular tasks like question answering and extracting labels from radiology reports.

Diagnosis means the process of determining which disease or condition explains the person's symptoms, signs, and medical results. In particular, we will be learning how to build and evaluate deep-learning models for the detection of disease from medical images. Just in the 1. week, we build a deep learning model that can interpret chest X-rays to classify different disease causes. In the 2. week, we will implement evaluation methodologies to assess the quality of your model. In the 3. week, we use image segmentation to identify the location and boundaries of brain tumors in MRI scans.
